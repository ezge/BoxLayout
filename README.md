The Compose Box layout positions all of its children on top
of each other in a stack arrangement, with the first child
positioned at the bottom of the stack. By default, this stack
will be placed in the top left-hand corner of the content
area, though this can be changed using the
contentAlignment parameter when calling the Box
composable.
